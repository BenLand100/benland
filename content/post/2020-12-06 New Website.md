I finally got around to buying an actual domain and [benland.us](https://benland.us) now points to my server. When I discovered the top level domain .land existed, I couldn't resist, and [ben.land](https://ben.land) is setup identically. Previously my website was a [MediaWiki instance, now archived in the Internet Archive,](https://web.archive.org/web/20161020025855/http://benland.us/index.php/Main_Page) and may contain useful information, but I have switched to using the statically generated site you see here, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The source repository is available [on my GitHub](https://github.com/BenLand100/benland).
