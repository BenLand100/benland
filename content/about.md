![PhDone!](/images/phdone.jpg#right)
I received my Ph.D. in Physics at UC Berkeley in 2019 after receiving a B.S. in Physics from Georgia Tech in 2013. 
Going from undergrad to graduate school, I entirely switched research interests from [atomic molecular and optical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics) (particularly [Bose-Einstein condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate)) to [weakly interacting physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction) and worked with a [group at Berkeley](https://underground.physics.berkeley.edu/) studying [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino).
Ultimately my thesis ended up being about using [solar neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino) to understand fundamental properties of neutrinos, and developing new neutrino detection techniques. 
You can find a copy [here](https://nino.lbl.gov/~benland100/thesis_final.pdf). 
During graduate school, my particular involvement was with the [SNO](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/), [SNO+](https://snoplus.phy.queensu.ca/), and [Theia](https://theia.berkeley.edu/index.php/Main_Page) projects.

Currently, I work as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania where I continue to research neutrinos in the [high energy physics neutrino group](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/research/high-energy-physics). 
I've remained involved in the SNO+ and Theia projects, and am getting involved in the [DUNE](https://www.dunescience.org/) experiment, where I'll be focusing on developing the cold electronics / supporting hardware for the detector and exploring solar neutrino interactions in liquid argon.

Otherwise, I am 30 years old and hail from Macon, GA. 
I am a long time programmer, have contributed to many projects, and learned many languages since I became interested in using computers to automate mundane human tasks (read: cheating on MMORPGs) back in the early aughts. 
Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/BenLand100) for more about the projects I deemed most interesting. 
Besides physics and programming, I enjoy the outdoors (that is, photographing them), Minecraft (with mods... lots of mods), and astronomy.
