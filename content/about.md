I received my Ph.D. in Physics at UC Berkeley in 2019 after receiving a B.S. in Physics from Georgia Tech in 2013, and generally was a nerd before that as well.
Going from undergrad to graduate school, I pivoted research interests from [atomic molecular and optical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics), with [a research group Georgia Tech](https://chapmanlabs.gatech.edu/) studying [Bose-Einstein condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate)), to [weakly interacting physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction), with a group at UC Berkeley studying [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino).

![berkeley!](/images/berkeley.png#rightsupersmall)Ultimately [my thesis](https://ben.land/files/thesis_final.pdf) was about using measurements of [solar neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino) to understand fundamental properties of neutrinos, and developing new neutrino detection techniques. 
During graduate school, I was a member of the [SNO](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/), [SNO+](https://snoplus.phy.queensu.ca/), and [Theia/EOS](https://nino.lbl.gov/eos/detector.html) collaborations.

After getting my PhD, I then did research as a postdoc at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/bland100/) where I continued to research neutrinos in the [high energy physics neutrino group](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/research/particle-physics). 
I remained involved in the SNO+ and Theia projects, and got involved in the [DUNE](https://www.dunescience.org/) experiment, where I focused on developing software for the cold electronics, data acquisition, and data selection, while exploring (solar) neutrino interactions in liquid argon.

After around a decade doing fundamental physics research, I decided to use the physics PhD and associated skills as leverage to pivot into data science and machine learning. 
I now work as a senior manager of machine learning at Comcast, applying the quantitative and analytical skills developed doing physics research to the problem of predicting optimal business strategies.
In this role my team and I develop new techniques and approaches for solving business problems at scale, as well as maintain the core infrastructure enabling the wider team to do work.

Otherwise, I am 34(+) years old, happily married, and currently live in Philadelphia suburbs after growing up in middle Georgia and spending some time on the west coast.
I am a long time programmer, Linux enthusiast, have contributed to many open source projects, and learned many programming languages since I became interested in using computers to automate mundane human tasks (read: automating MMORPGs) back in the early aughts. 
Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/BenLand100) and [blog posts](https://ben.land/post/) for more about the projects I consider most interesting. 
Besides physics and programming, I enjoy the [photography](https://ben.land/photos/), [beekeeping](https://ben.land/beecam/), video games (Minecraft, Factorio, Rimworld...), tinkering with electronics, amateur radio, and [astrophotography](https://ben.land/astro/).
